## Link: [https://frontend-developer-capstone.pages.dev](https://frontend-developer-capstone.pages.dev)

## Overview

This project is designed to demonstrate your front-end development skills by building a web app for **Little Lemon**, a fictional restaurant. Throughout the course, you have revisited key concepts of React and front-end development, and applied them to develop an interactive table booking form for the restaurant. This project serves as a culmination of the skills learned, allowing you to showcase your ability to create a fully functional, user-friendly web app.

### Learning Objectives
- Reinforce fundamental front-end development concepts.
- Apply React to build dynamic and interactive components.
- Build a user-friendly web app that handles table bookings for a restaurant.
- Gain experience with real-world project structures and peer reviews.

## Project Requirements

### Key Features:
1. **Table Booking Form:**
   - Users should be able to input their name, the date and time of booking, and the number of people.
   - The form should handle form validation to ensure all fields are properly filled.
   - The form should submit the data to the app and provide user feedback upon successful submission.

2. **React Components:**
   - The project should include various reusable React components (e.g., Form, Input fields, Submit Button).
   - Use state and props effectively to manage data flow between components.

3. **Styling:**
   - Apply appropriate CSS styles to create a responsive and visually appealing UI.
   - Ensure the form is accessible and looks good on different screen sizes.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement basic error handling for user input (e.g., required fields, invalid inputs).

## Instructions

1. **Build the Web App:**
   - Using React, create the necessary components and manage state to capture and display table booking information.
   - Ensure the app is interactive and user-friendly.

2. **Submit for Peer Review:**
   - Once your project is complete, submit it for review by two of your peers. This will give you the opportunity to gain feedback and improve your app.

3. **Peer Review Process:**
   - Review two projects submitted by your peers. Provide constructive feedback on functionality, usability, and code quality.
   - Be specific with your suggestions to help your peers improve their work.

4. **Final Submission:**
   - After completing your peer reviews and incorporating any feedback, submit your final version of the project for grading.

## Grading Criteria

Your project will be graded based on the following criteria:
- **Functionality:** Does the app meet the requirements? Does the table booking form work as expected?
- **Code Quality:** Is the code clean, well-organized, and properly commented?
- **User Experience:** Is the form easy to use? Does the UI look polished and responsive?
- **Peer Reviews:** Are your peer reviews constructive and thorough?
